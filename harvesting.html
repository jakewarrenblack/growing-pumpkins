<h2>The hardest part is over!</h2>

<p>The other stages were by far the most difficult part of cultivating your pumpkins. Now that we're on the harvesting stage, lets discuss best practice for removing your pumpkins
from the vine, setting up a compost bin now that you have left over vine and leaves, and washing your pumpkins down. We'll also get into
some of the recipes you can try, including roast pumpkin chunks, pumpkin soup, pumpkin pie, pumpkin pancakes, and pumpkin swiss roll.

<ol class="cutting">

	<li>Before doing anything else, press the nail of your index finger hard into the pumpkin and make sure it's not soft. If there's any relief when touching it, it's not ripe.</li>
	<li>To begin, use a sharp secateurs to cut the the pumpkin from the vine</li>
	<li>Try to leave at least 4 inches of vine above the pumpkin, this will protect the pumpkin from rot</li>
	<li>You can pull up all the vine and leaves and put them in your compost bin, just leave them aside for now and we'll talk about how to do this later.</li>
	<li>Wash your pumpkins down with warm water. I also clean them down with disinfectant wipes.</li>
	<li>Cut the pumpkin into quarters first, and then cut the quarters into cubes. Kids get an adult to help!</li>
	<li>You can then keep the cubes in ziplock bags in the freezer for up to six months.</li>
	<li>Six months later it's almost time to plant again!</li>
