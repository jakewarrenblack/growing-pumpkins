Site Name: Growing Pumpkins

Functional Description: The function of this website
is to inform the audience of how to cultivate, harvest, and
prepare pumpkins for eating in various ways. The target audience
are those interested in gardening and cooking.

Website Functionality Testing:

Mozilla Firefox – Version 65.0.2 (64-bit)

Google Chrome – Version 72.0.3626.121 (64-bit)

Opera – Version 58 (64-bit)

Base Functionality: 

Google Chrome:

All links and menus function correctly on both mobile and desktop versions.

Opera:

All links and menus function correctly on both mobile and desktop versions.

Mozilla Firefox:

All links and menus function correctly on desktop version, however burger menu does not function on mobile version.

Graphical User Interface:

Google Chrome: Look and feel of the application is as intended.

Opera: Look and feel of the application is as intended.

Mozilla Firefox: Look and feel of the application is as intended.

However, on all three browsers’ ‘responsive design mode’, when emulating a mobile viewport, a different colour area appears outside of the page until the burger menu is clicked.

Response:

Google Chrome: The browser responds as intended to user actions.

Opera: The browser responds as intended to user actions.

Mozilla Firefox: The browser responds as intended to user actions, with the exception of the burger menu which does not respond to the user’s click.

Performance:

Google Chrome: I have encountered no issues in the loading of any page.

Opera: I have encountered no issues in the loading of any page.

Mozilla Firefox: I have encountered no issues in the loading of any page.

The issues I have encountered relating to the rectangular area appearing outside the main content, 
and the burger menu issue in Firefox both only apply to the emulated mobile viewport. 
I do not encounter either of these issues in the mobile versions of:

Chrome (72.0.3626.121 - 32-bit) ,

Opera (50.3.2476.136976 - 32-bit), 

Firefox (65.0.1 - 32-bit).
