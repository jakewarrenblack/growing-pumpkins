<h1>Video 1 Transcript</h1>	

<p>hi my name is Mark Hutton and I'm the
Cooperative Extension vegetable
specialist for the University of Maine
what I'd like to talk to you about today
is pumpkin harvest as you can see here
we've got quite a crop of pumpkins ready
to go
you may be wondering so what are we
going to do with these pumpkins from now
until Halloween and the simple answer is
is that they'll store quite well up
through there with careful planning and
careful handling when we're harvesting
pumpkins we want to use some sort of
shear or cutters or knives to remove the
fruit from the vine and here you can see
I'm just using a small hand shear and we
just simply cut the stem we don't want
to rip the stem from the plant we want
to have a nice clean cut that's going to
be able to heal so when we're harvesting
pumpkins normally what we're going to
want to do is come through and cut all
the fruit from the vine and put them in
wind rows and then come back and pick
them up later at this time of year we
can harvest our pumpkins and bring them
in and store them if your pumpkin field
is in pretty good shape like this one
our foliage isn't down too badly we
can't store them or let them stay in the
field but more often as a commercial
grower you're going to be better off by
getting the fruit out of the field and
up to the barn that's going to save them
from being exposed to Sun burning the
pest or predator damaged deer eating
them
groundhogs eating them squash cucumber
beetle all sorts of things that can
reduce the quality so it's really best
to get them out of the field curing and
storage of pumpkins involves bringing
them in out of the field and allowing
them to sit at 80 to 85 degrees for 10
to 14 days this curing process allows
the skin to harden it also gives a
chance for the end of the stem to cure
or heal over both of those things are
going to help reduce the incidence of
disease and prolong the storage life and
quality of the fruit diseased rotten or
damaged fruit should be left in the
field and
not brought in for curing and storage
often were asked what about green fruit
green fruited pumpkins once they begin
to turn color will continue to ripen and
turn color even at once after they're
harvested so it's alright to bring
something like this in and it will
continue to color up and be ready for
sale in time for Halloween we're often
asked how long pumpkins will store and I
can tell you that this pumpkin was
harvested last season so it's lasted
over a year inside our office it was
cured well cured the stem dried down
nicely we didn't have any disease so
pumpkins can last up to a year

<h2>Video 2 Transcript</h2>
<p>Hi everyone and welcome back to my channel.
Today I’m sharing with you a recipe for roasted pumpkin soup. It’s full of flavour
and very easy to make. So if you would like to learn how to make it then just keep on
watching.
For this soup I’m roasting the pumpkin which I think gives it a lot more flavour than if
you were to boil it. So to start off, remove the seeds from half of a small pumpkin, about
1kg or a little over 2 pounds.
You can save the seeds if you would like and roast then as well, they’re great in salads
or to snack on.
I’ll have link to my website in the information box which has a printable version of this
recipe.
Once you have removed the seeds cut the pumpkin into wedges. If you don’t have much time
cut it into smaller pieces and it will roast a lot faster.
Place the wedges of pumpkin into a dish and pour over some oil and season with some salt
and pepper.
Place the
pumpkin into a preheated oven and roast for about 1-2 hours or until the pumpkin is soft
and caramelised at the edges.
Leave it to cool while you prepare the remaining ingredients.
In a medium sized pan heat a small amount of oil over medium heat. Slice up an onion
and add to the pan. Make sure to keep the heat medium as you don’t want to add colour
to the onion, you just want to cook it until it becomes soft and clear.
Dice up 3 cloves of garlic and add these to that pan also. Continue cooking for about
10 minutes.
While the onion and garlic are cooking I’m going to remove the flesh of the pumpkin from
the skin. The pumpkin should be soft and cooled down by now so it should come out easily.
Just use a spoon and scoop it out into a bowl.
By this time the onion and garlic should be soft. Here is the time to add any flavourings
you would like to the soup. There are endless possibilities but I’m just using a tablespoon
of ground coriander. Add it to the pan and cook until fragrant.
Now start adding your stock. Depending on the consistency you would like your soup to
be only add half of your stock first. If you would like it thinner you can always add more
when you blend it. I’ve just used 2 cups here because I like a thicker soup. Stir to
make sure everything is combined.
Add the stock mixture and pumpkin to a blender or to a pot if you are using a stick blender.
Blend until everything is completely smooth. If you would like a thinner soup just add
more stock.
Pour your soup into a bowl, garnishing with some cream and parsley and serve with some
crusty bread.
This soup freezes great so don’t be afraid to make an extra large batch, it’s perfect
for lunches.
Thank you for watching and I’ll see you in my next video. Bye</p>

bottom out of a pumpkin so I'm gonna do
that right now so I got the bottom cut
out of my pumpkin and as you can see
there's lots of slimy stringy stuff in
there

just comes all out all right so the
hardest part was cleaning off the little
spinny device but yeah it doesn't really
good job can you see in there so I'm
going in you can see everything is
hollowed out do that you did a good job

bit more than two minutes but I'll tell
